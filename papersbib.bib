  abstract = {Clustering is a very important topic in machine learning and knowledge discovery research. Many methods have been proposed, each based on dierent assumptions and models. In this paper we propose an improvement of the Principal Direction Divisive Partitioning algorithm. The proposed algorithm merges concepts from density estimation and projection-based methods towards a fast and ecient clustering algorithm, capable of dealing with high dimensional data. Experimental results show improved partitioning performance compared to other popular methods. Moreover, we explore the problem of automatically determining the number of clusters that is central in cluster analysis.}

One of the most important of them is associated with high data dimensionality. A particular class of clustering algorithms has been very successful in dealing with such datasets, utilising information driven by the principal component analysis. In this work, we try to deepen our understanding on what can be achieved by this kind of approaches. We attempt to theoretically discover the relationship between true clusters in the data and the distribution of their projection onto the principal components. Based on such findings, we propose appropriate criteria for the various steps involved in hierarchical divisive clustering and develop compilations of them into new algorithms. The proposed algorithms require minimal user-defined parameters and have the desirable feature of being able to provide approximations for the number of clusters present in the data. The experimental results indicate that the proposed techniques are effective in simulated as well as real data scenarios.}

One of the most important challenges in the field is dealing with high dimensional datasets. The class of clustering algorithms that utilises information from Principal Component Analysis has proven very successful in such datasets. Unlike previous approaches employing principal components, in this paper we propose a technique that uses a quality criterion to select the most important dimension (projection). This criterion permits us to formulate the problem as an optimisation task over the space of projections. However, in high dimensional spaces this problem is hard to solve and analytic solutions are not available. Thus, we tackle this problem through the use of an evolutionary algorithm. The experimental results indicate that the proposed techniques are effective in both simulated and real data scenarios.}

Here, we couple this dimension reduction technique with data clustering algorithms that are specially designed for high dimensional cases. First, we show that the theoretical properties of both components can be combined in a sound manner, promising an effective clustering framework. Indeed, for a series of simulated and real ultra high dimensional data scenarios, as the experimental analysis shows, the resulting algorithms achieve high quality data partitions, orders of magnitude faster.}

This trend is expected to continue in the near future, putting an emphasis on applicability of big data techniques to leverage biologically important insights. Moreover, with the increasing density of sampling, it may also be necessary to consider alignment-free sequence analysis techniques combined with clustering to yield a sufficient insight to data. This leads to ultra high-dimensional data with tens of millions of variables, which can no longer be handled by the existing population genomic methods. Using the largest bacterial sequence data sets published to date, we demonstrate that random projection based clustering provides a highly accurate and several orders of magnitude faster approach to the analysis of both alignment-based and alignment-free genome data sets, compared with the Bayesian model-based analysis that is currently considered as the state-of-the-art. Hence, clustering methods for big data harbor considerable potential for important applications in genomics and could pave way for novel analysis pipelines even in the online setting when executed in a massively parallel computing environment.}

  abstract = {Visualizing low-dimensional non-linear manifolds underlying high-dimensional data is a challenging data analysis problem. Different manifold visualization methods can be characterized by the associated definitions of proximity between highdimensional data points and score functions that lead to different low-dimensional embeddings, preserving different features in the data. The geodesic distance is a popular and well-justified metric. However, it is very hard to approximate reliably from finite samples especially between far apart points. In this paper, we propose a new method called Minimap. The basic idea is to approximate local geodesic distances by shortest paths along a neighborhood graph with an additional penalizing factor based on the number of steps in the path. Embedding the resulting metric by Sammon mapping further enhances the local structures at the expense of long distances that tend to be less reliable. Experiments on real-world benchmarks suggest that Minimap can robustly visualize manifold structures.}

The proposed minimum density hyperplane minimises the integral of the empirical probability density function along it, thereby avoiding intersection with high density clusters. We show that the minimum density and the maximum margin hyperplanes are asymptotically equivalent, thus linking this approach to maximum margin clustering and semi-supervised support vector classifiers. We propose a projection pursuit formulation of the associated optimisation problem which allows us to find minimum density hyperplanes efficiently in practice, and evaluate its performance on a range of benchmark data sets. The proposed approach is found to be very competitive with state of the art methods for clustering and semi-supervised classification.}

The key idea is to exploit the redundancy in a large number of candidate sets obtained by independently generated random projections in order to reduce the number of expensive exact distance evaluations. The method is straightforward to implement using sparse projections which leads to a reduced memory footprint and fast index construction. Furthermore, it enables grouping of the required computations into big matrix multiplications, which leads to additional savings due to cache effects and low-level parallelization. We demonstrate by extensive experiments on a wide variety of data sets that the method is faster than existing partitioning tree or hashing based approaches, making it the fastest available technique on high accuracy levels.}

While this situation contributes significantly to the quality of human life, unfortunately it involves enormous dangers, since online texts with high toxicity can cause personal attacks, online harassment and bullying behaviors. This has triggered both industrial and research community in the last few years while there are several attempts to identify an efficient model for online toxic comment prediction. However, these steps are still in their infancy and new approaches and frameworks are required. On parallel, the data explosion that appears constantly, makes the construction of new machine learning computational tools for managing this information, an imperative need. Thankfully advances in hardware, cloud computing and big data management allow the development of Deep Learning approaches appearing very promising performance so far. For text classification in particular the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have recently been proposed approaching text analytics in a modern manner emphasizing in the structure of words in a document. In this work, we employ this approach to discover toxic comments in a large pool of documents provided by a current Kaggle's competition regarding Wikipedia's talk page edits. To justify this decision we choose to compare CNNs against the traditional bag-of-words approach for text analysis combined with a selection of algorithms proven to be very effective in text classification. The reported results provide enough evidence that CNN enhance toxic comment classification reinforcing research interest towards this direction.}

  abstract = {Biomedicine is undergoing a revolution driven by the explosion of biomedical data, which are generated by emerged medical imaging, sensor technologies and high-throughput technologies. An indicative example is the single cell sequencing technology which concerns the genome sequencing examination of hundreds of separate cells in a single tumor. Consequently, open challenges arising from this emerged technology and generally from the evolution of biomedical technologies under the big data perspective. Also, given the fact that approaches based on high-performance computing require high computing resources and advanced developers, solutions that reduce the problem complexity remain very attractive. Following this direction, in this paper a classification scheme based on Multiple Random Projections and Voting is presented. Random Projections offer a platform not only for a low computational time analysis by significantly reducing the data dimensionality, but also for an accurate analysis which may well exceed classical classification approaches. The proposed method was applied on real biomedical high dimensional data and compared against well-known classification schemes as to Random Projection-based cutting-edge methods. Specifically, we applied it on expression profiles for single-cell RNA-seq data from non-diabetic and type 2 diabetic human samples. Experimental results showed that based on simplistic tools we can create a computationally fast, simple, yet effective approach for biomedical Big Data analysis and knowledge discovery.}

Although sentiment analysis is an accurate approach for observing the crowd behavior, it is incapable of discovering other types of information in text, such as toxicity, which can usually reveal hidden information. Towards this direction, a model for temporal tracking of comments toxicity is proposed using tweets related to the hashtag under study. More specifically, a classifier is trained for toxic comments prediction using a Convolutional Neural Network model. Next, given a hashtag all relevant tweets are parsed and used as input in the classifier, hence, the knowledge about toxic texts is transferred to a new dataset for categorization. In the meantime, an adapted change detection approach is applied for monitoring the toxicity trend changes over time within the hashtag tweets. Our experimental results showed that toxic comment classification on twitter conversations can reveal significant knowledge and changes in the toxicity are accurately identified over time.}

  abstract = {The most commonly prescribed painkiller worldwide, paracetamol (acetaminophen, APAP) is also the predominant cause of acute liver failure (ALF), and therefore paracetamol-induced liver toxicity remains an important clinical problem. The standard clinical treatment framework for paracetamol overdose currently allows for antidote therapy decisions to be made based on a nomogram treatment line. This treatment threshold is lowered for patients adjudged to be highly susceptible to liver injury due to risk factors such as anorexia nervosa or bulimia. Additionally, both the original and adjusted clinical frameworks are highly dependent on knowledge from the patient regarding time since ingestion and initial dose amount, both of which are often highly unpredictable. We have recently developed a pre-clinical framework for predicting time since ingestion, initial dose amount and subsequent probability of liver injury based on novel biomarker concentrations. Here, we use identifiability analysis as a tool to increase confidence in our model parameter estimates and extend the framework to make predictions for both healthy and high-risk populations. Through pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model refinement, we identify thresholds that determine whether necrosis or apoptosis is the dominant form of cell death, which can be essential for effective ALF interventions. Using a single blood test, rather than the multiple tests required in the current clinical frameworks, our model provides overdose identification information applicable for healthy and high-risk individuals as well as quantitative measures of estimated liver injury probability.}

A recent technology is the single-cell RNA sequencing, which allows transcriptomics measurements in individual cells, having promising results. However, such studies measure the entire genome for thousands of cells, creating datasets with extremely high dimensionality and complexity. Following this perspective, we propose a dimensionality reduction approach, called RGt-SNE, which visualizes single-cell RNA-seq data in two dimensions. Initially, RGt-SNE defines a cell-cell distance matrix based on Random Projections and Geodesic Distances. The first is used to define the pairwise cells distances in a low dimensional projected space avoiding the difficulties that exist in data with ultra-high dimensionality. The latter is used to better define the large pairwise cells distances. Subsequently, the t-SNE method is applied in the customized distance matrix for two dimensional visualization. RGt-SNE was evaluated in two real experimental single-cell RNA-seq data against three well-known methods, such as t-SNE, Multidimensional scaling, and ISOMAP. Outcomes provide the superiority of RGt-SNE suggesting it as a reliable tool for single-cell RNA-seq data analysis and visualization.}

On parallel, Systems Biology approaches can tackle part of this complexity, since they are based on biological networks elucidating genotype to phenotype relationships in a more comprehensive framework. Hence, research community is shifting towards singlecell systems biology approaches to identify and validate disease-specific biomarkers. Under this perspective, we propose a methodological framework aimed to infer disease-specific subpathway activities, using cell signaling pathway topology and transcriptomics data derived from single-cell RNA-seq technologies. More specifically, we concatenated and integrated pathway network refining with single-cell expression profiles. Linear subpathways were extracted and a subpathway profile score was calculated taking into account the pathway information flow. The core of our method is XGBoost supervised classification based on the aforementioned score in order to identify important subpathways that control the rest of the network and cause major changes from a control to a disease state under study. The proposed methodology was applied to a real experimental study with single-cell RNA-seq expression profiles revealing changes in type 2 diabetes. Exported subpathways showed promising results, suggesting that the proposed approach can reliably identify subpathways, acting as potential disease-specific biomarkers.}

However, such studies create extremely high dimensional data isolating expression profiles for thousands or even millions of cells. Consequently, dealing with single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data is considered the main challenge for unsupervised clustering, which can be used in order to identify grouped cell types. Towards this direction, we present a framework that enhances hierarchical clustering utilizing Proximity Learning on Random Projected spaces (PLRP). The proposed method's efficiency lies in the fact that we exploit the distances from multiple significantly lower dimension spaces defined by Random Projections using ensembles of k-nearest neighbor searches. In the transformed data we applied hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) improving significantly its performance when compared against using the original space. The performance of the proposed PLRP was evaluated in a publicly available experimental dataset with scRNA-seq expression profiles, against three well-established clustering tools. The results showed that our approach greatly enhances clustering performance exposing its applicability in ultra-high dimensions and imposing further development towards this direction.}

This revolution driven by the explosion of biomedical data offers the potential for better understanding of biology and human diseases. An illustrative example is the emerging single-cell sequencing technologies, which isolate and measure each cell individually, taking a step beyond the traditional techniques where consider their measurements from a bulk of cell. Although big single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data promises valuable insights into the cellular level, their volume poses several challenges related to the ultra-high dimensionality. Furthermore, to further elucidate the potential of these data, more insight into gene regulatory networks (GRN) is required. Network-based approaches can tackle part of the inherent complexity of human diseases, however, the challenges related to the ultra-high dimensionality are increased. Towards this direction, we propose the NIRP, an algorithm that copes with the high dimensionality of scRNA-data using a workflow based on fast multiple random projections and a radius-based nearest neighbors search. NIRP infers a gene regulatory network (GRN) from big scRNA-seq data by transforming the original data space to a lower dimensions space and capturing the similarities among gene expressions. The network is further analyzed using a random walk approach in order to achieve dense subgraphs, active to the case under study. The performance of NIRP is evaluated in a real single-cell experimental study among three well-established GRN tools. Our results make NIRP a reliable tool, able to handle big single-cell data with ultra-high dimensionality and complexity. he main advantage of this method is that it is not affected by the volume, as much as it increases, since it transforms the data space to a specific low dimensional space.}

Given the fact that Twitter messages are generated constantly with dizzying rates, a huge volume of streaming data is created, thus there is an imperative need for accurate methods for knowledge discovery and mining of this information. Although there exists a plethora of twitter sentiment analysis methods in the recent literature, the researchers have shifted to real-time sentiment identification on twitter streaming data, as expected. A major challenge is to deal with the Big Data challenges arising in Twitter streaming applications concerning both Volume and Velocity. Under this perspective, in this paper, a methodological approach based on open source tools is provided for real-time detection of changes in sentiment that is ultra efficient with respect to both memory consumption and computational cost. This is achieved by iteratively collecting tweets in real time and discarding them immediately after their process. For this purpose, we employ the Lexicon approach for sentiment characterizations, while change detection is achieved through appropriate control charts that do not require historical information. We believe that the proposed methodology provides the trigger for a potential large-scale monitoring of threads in an attempt to discover fake news spread or propaganda efforts in their early stages. Our experimental real-time analysis based on a recent hashtag provides evidence that the proposed approach can detect meaningful sentiment changes across a hashtags lifetime.}

We expect that a limited number of skin lesion images is enough to affect significantly the later data-specific layers. Furthermore, we propose a pre-process step for skin lesion images that segments and crops the lesion, whereas smooths the effect of image masking, thus enhancing the network’s classification capabilities. The reported results are very promising, since the overall accuracy, as well as the accuracy of individual class classification improved in 7 out of the 8 classes, suggesting future developments in medical diagnosis through pre-trained deep learning models and specialized image prefiltering.}

Towards this direction, we study the generalization of the MRPV, a recently published ensemble classification algorithm, which combines multiple ultra-low dimensional random projected spaces with a voting scheme, while exposing its ability to enhance the performance of base classifiers. We empirically showed that we can design a reliable ensemble classification technique using random projected subspaces in an extremely small fixed number of dimensions, without following the restrictions of the classical random projection method. Therefore, the MPRV acquires the ability to efficiently and rapidly perform classification tasks even for data with extremely high dimensionality. Furthermore, through the experimental analysis in six scRNA-seq data, we provided evidence that the most critical advantage of MRPV is the dramatic reduction in data dimensionality that allows for the utilization of computational demanding classifiers that are considered as non-practical in real-life applications. The scalability, the simplicity, and the capabilities of our proposed framework render it as a tool-guide for single-cell RNA-seq data which are characterized by ultra-high dimensionality.

	abstract = {The continuous positioning of a mobile user equipment (MU) in a prompt way is a fundamental requirement in several indoor applications related to ubiquitous computation, assisted living environments, and security/surveillance systems. Motivated by this fact, the current contribution reports a low-complexity visible light positioning (VLP) method suitable for indoor environments in the Big Data era. The proposed architecture consists of multiple light-emitting diodes (LEDs) as light sources and an MU equipped with a photodiode (PD). To guarantee higher spectral efficiency, the LEDs emit sinusoidal waveforms at slightly different predetermined frequencies. The light intensity received at the PD from every LED is continuously estimated after applying a short-time Fourier transformation. To this end, a grid-based numerical technique is proposed to recover the unknown MU position. Additionally, a closed-form solution is presented for the particular case of three LEDs that overrides the need for training points in the grid arrangement. Further, a method for handling noisy signals is proposed, based on averaging the calculated positions from densely overlapping received signals. Finally, a Kalman filter is employed as a post-processing precision improving tool. The proposed VLP efficiency is quantified through respective Monte Carlo simulations that allow the setting of different LED frequencies, received signal processing parameters, MU speed, and noise levels. The results reveal that the suggested approach is robust with significant tolerance in high ambient light levels, computationally efficient, and exhibits low positional error. Finally, to evaluate the performance improvements the new method introduces, we make comparisons against widely-used fingerprint approaches.}

	abstract = {Throughout the last decades, neuromorphic circuits have incited the interest of scientists, as they are potentially a powerful tool for the treatment of neurological diseases. To this end, it is essential to consider the biological principles of the CNS and develop the appropriate area- and power-efficient circuits. Motivated by studies that outline the indispensable role of astrocytes in the dynamic regulation of synaptic transmission and their active contribution to neural information processing in the CNS, in this work we propose a digital implementation of neuron\&ndash;astrocyte bidirectional interactions. In order to describe the neuronal dynamics and the astrocytes\&rsquo; calcium dynamics, a modified version of the original Izhikevich neuron model was combined with a linear approximation of the Postnov functional neural\&ndash;glial interaction model. For the implementation of the neural\&ndash;glial computation core, only three pipeline stages and a 10.10 fixed point representation were utilized. Regarding the results obtained from the FPGA implementation and the comparisons to other works, the proposed neural\&ndash;glial circuit reported significant savings in area requirements (from 22.53{\%} up to 164.20{\%}) along with considerable savings in total power consumption of 28.07{\%} without sacrificing output computation accuracy. Finally, an RMSE analysis was conducted, confirming that this particular implementation produces more accurate results compared to previous studies.},

This measure led to a decrease in face-to-face social interactions and, as an equivalent, an increase in the use of social media platforms, such as Twitter. As part of Industry 4.0, sentiment analysis can be exploited to study public attitudes toward future pandemics and sociopolitical situations in general. This work presents an analysis framework by applying a combination of natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to classify the sentiment of each tweet as positive, or negative. Through extensive experimentation, we expose the ideal model for this task and, subsequently, utilize sentiment predictions to perform time series analysis over the course of the pandemic. In addition, a change point detection algorithm was applied in order to identify the turning points in public attitudes toward the pandemic, which were validated by cross-referencing the news report at that particular period of time. Finally, we study the relationship between sentiment trends on social media and, news coverage of the pandemic, providing insights into the public's perception of the pandemic and its influence on the news.},

To overcome this obstacle, motivated by the widespread success of Cooperative Neural Networks, an innovative supervised dimensionality reduction framework is proposed, based on a cooperative two phase optimization strategy. Specifically, the proposed framework that requires minimal parameter adjustment consists of an autoencoder for dimensionality reduction and a separator network for separability assessment of the embedding. This scheme results in meaningful and discriminable codes, which are optimized for the classification task and are exploitable by any trainable classifier. The experimental results showed that the proposed methodology achieved competitive results against the state-of-the-art competing methods, while being much more efficient in terms of parameter count. Finally, it was empirically justified that the proposed methodology introduces advanced behavioural explainability, while enabling applicability for image generation tasks.},

	abstract = {We are in the big data era which has affected several domains including biomedicine and healthcare. This revolution driven by the explosion of biomedical data offers the potential for better understanding of biology and human diseases. An illustrative example is the emerging single-cell sequencing technologies, which isolate and measure each cell individually, taking a step beyond the traditional techniques where consider their measurements from a bulk of cell. Although big single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data promises valuable insights into the cellular level, their volume poses several challenges related to the ultra-high dimensionality. Furthermore, to further elucidate the potential of these data, more insight into gene regulatory networks (GRN) is required. Network-based approaches can tackle part of the inherent complexity of human diseases, however, the challenges related to the ultra-high dimensionality are increased. Towards this direction, we propose the NIRP, an algorithm that copes with the high dimensionality of scRNA-data using a workflow based on fast multiple random projections and a radius-based nearest neighbors search. NIRP infers a gene regulatory network (GRN) from big scRNA-seq data by transforming the original data space to a lower dimensions space and capturing the similarities among gene expressions. The network is further analyzed using a random walk approach in order to achieve dense subgraphs, active to the case under study. The performance of NIRP is evaluated in a real single-cell experimental study among three well-established GRN tools. Our results make NIRP a reliable tool, able to handle big single-cell data with ultra-high dimensionality and complexity. he main advantage of this method is that it is not affected by the volume, 
	as much as it increases, since it transforms the data space to a specific low dimensional space.}

An indicative example is the single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), an emerging DNA sequencing technology with promising capabilities but significant computational challenges due to the large-scaled generated data. Regarding the classification process for scRNA-seq data, an appropriate method is the k Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier since it is usually utilized for large-scale prediction tasks due to its simplicity, minimal parameterization, and model-free nature. However, the ultra-high dimensionality that characterizes scRNA-seq impose a computational bottleneck, while prediction power can be affected by the \"{}Curse of Dimensionality\"{}. In this work, we proposed the utilization of approximate nearest neighbor search algorithms for the task of kNN classification in scRNA-seq data focusing on a particular methodology tailored for high dimensional data. We argue that even relaxed approximate solutions will not affect the prediction performance significantly. The experimental results confirm the original assumption by offering the potential for broader applicability.},

	abstract = {Big data methods prevail in the biomedical domain leading to effective and scalable data-driven approaches. Biomedical data are known for their ultra-high dimensionality, especially the ones coming from molecular biology experiments. This property is also included in the emerging technique of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), where we obtain sequence information from individual cells. A reliable way to uncover their complexity is by using Machine Learning approaches, including dimensional reduction and feature selection methods. Although the first choice has had remarkable progress in scRNA-seq data, only the latter can offer deeper interpretability at the gene level since it highlights the dominant gene features in the given data. Towards tackling this challenge, we propose a feature selection framework that utilizes genetic optimization principles and identifies low-dimensional combinations of gene lists in order to enhance classification performance of any off-the-shelf classifier (e.g., LDA or SVM). Our intuition is that by identifying an optimal genes subset, we can enhance the prediction power of scRNA-seq data even if these genes are unrelated to each other. We showcase our proposed framework's effectiveness in two real scRNA-seq experiments with gene dimensions up to 36708. Our framework can identify very low-dimensional subsets of genes (less than 200) while boosting the classifiers'performance. Finally, we provide a biological interpretation of the selected genes, thus providing evidence of our method's utility towards explainable artificial intelligence.},

Image clustering, refers to one of the most challenging specifications of clustering, concerning image data. Thankfully, the emerging Deep Neural Networks, and in particular Deep Autoencoders lead to the automation of image clustering, which until recently, was time consuming and labor intensive. However, the effect of the consideration of local structure during feature extraction from a Variational Autoencoder on clustering, is still an unstudied subject in the literature, while simultaneously constitute a baseline approach for supervised learning (Convolutional Neural Networks). For this reason, the methodology proposed in this paper, is composed from a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) surrounded by a convolutional network in a symmetric way. The resulting embedded image data are fed to various established clustering algorithms to examine clustering performance. In addition, we propose a modification of this approach, able to reduce complexity while achieving similar or even better clustering performance. Finally, we investigate the combination of VAE’s produced embedding and manifold learning for image clustering. The extensive experimental analysis, verified the importance of the proposed methodology, exposing the potential for further developments.}

From the computational and mathematical perspective, we have to deal with a dataset with ultra-high volume and ultra-high dimensionality in several experimental studies. An indicative example is DNA sequencing technologies, which offer a more realistic picture of human diseases at the molecular biology level. However, these technologies produce data with high complexity and ultra-high dimensionality. On the other hand, dimensionality reduction techniques are the first choice to address this complexity, revealing the hidden data structure in the original multidimensional space. Also, such techniques can improve the efficiency of machine learning tasks such as classification and clustering. Towards this direction, we study the behavior of seven well-known and cutting-edge dimensionality reduction techniques tailored for RNA-sequencing data. Along with the study of the effect of these algorithms, we propose the extension of the Random projection and Geodesic distance t-Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (RGt-SNE) algorithm, a recent t-Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) improvement. We suggest a new distance criterion for the kernel matrix construction. Our results show the potential of the proposed algorithm and, at the same time, highlight the complexity of the COVID-19 data, which are not separable, creating a significant challenge that the Machine Learning field will have to face.},

That data, however, is scattered, not designed to be combined, collected in different time periods and their volume is constantly increasing. In this paper, we present an automated methodology that collects, refines, groups and combines data for a large number of countries. Most of these data resources are directly related to COVID-19 but we also choose to include other types of variables for each country, which may be of particular interest for researchers working in understanding the COVID-19 pandemic. The presented methodology unifies critical information regarding the pandemic. It is implemented in Python, provided as a simple script that extracts data, in the form of a daily time series, in a short period of time, directly available to be incorporated for analysis.},

This unprecedented circumstance led to an increase in traffic on social media platforms, one of the most popular of which is Twitter, with a diverse spectrum of users from around the world. This quality, along with the ability to use its API for research purposes, makes it a valuable resource for data collection and analysis. In this paper we aim to present the sentiments towards the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccines as it was imprinted through the users'tweets when the events were actually still in motion. For our research, we gathered the related data from Twitter and characterized the gathered tweets in two classes, positive and negative; using the BERT model, with an accuracy of 99{\%}. Finally, we performed various time series analyses based on people's sentiment with reference to the pandemic period of 2021, the four major vaccine's companies as well as on the vaccine's technology.},

Deep learning-based techniques have recently dominated ACL injury detection in MRI research. The goal of this study is to develop a robust and lightweight deep learning pipeline for identifying ACL in 3D MRI data of healthy knees. Specifically, we aim at finding the slices in the sagittal plane where the ACL is present. This could be utilized by clinicians for further evaluation. To this end, we build and test an advanced pipeline that relies on the newest object detection network, YOLOv5-Nano. We go on to compare our model to other pipelines that rely on YOLOv5-xlarge, YOLOX-small and YOLOX-nano. YOLOv5-nano is shown to be the best performer, obtaining the highest overall mAP@0.5 performance (0.9727) on augmented data, while at the same time having the smallest model size (3.7 MB). Conclusive object detection is a key step in identifying damage. YOLOv5-nano offers a great solution towards achieving robust object detection
	healthcare systems that will permit local processing by devices with limited computational resources.}

More precisely, we focus on estimating uncommon behaviors within daily activities as an indication for further examination. Challenge-point of the proposed methodology is the agnostic knowledge of different behaviours of individual's movement. Based on accelerometer sensor data collected from mobile devices, the proposed framework utilizes state-of-the-art Machine Learning models for Human Activity Recognition and introduces new Deep Hybrid Models for outlier detection suggesting a solid basis for further developments and wider applicability.}

On the other hand, unsupervised learning has shown to be able to assist in high-dimensional data, allowing the discovery of unknown patterns through clustering, visualization, dimensionality reduction, and in some cases, their combination. This work highlights unsupervised learning methodologies for large-scale, high-dimensional data, providing the potential of a unified framework that combines the knowledge retrieved from clustering and visualization. The main purpose is to uncover hidden patterns in a high-dimensional mixed dataset, which we achieve through our application in a complex, real-world dataset.

However, they may cause side effects promoting craving. Pomegranate is a natural substance that contains antioxidant polyphenolic compounds, which have been associated with craving reduction. Aim: The NUTRIDOPE (NUTRItion - driven Detoxification of OPioid addicted patieEnts) study aims to investigate the role of pomegranate juice consumption by opioid patients under buprenorphine and methadone on craving, as the primary outcome, and biopsychosocial parameters.
	Methodology: NUTRIDOPE (NUTRItion - driven Detoxification of OPioid addicted patieEnts) study is a randomized control trial with repeated measures: - that has been registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT05861544). The participants, who will be patients with OUDs attending rehab programs in the Greek Organization Against Drugs (OKANA), will be randomly divided into the experimental and the control groups and both groups will be further stratified into two subgroups, i.e., methadone and buprenorphine, according to the maintenance treatment program they attend. Pomegranate juice will be administered to the participants of the experimental group, whereas their counterparts in the control group will not consume any similar beverage. The administration regimen will be 250 ml, seven days/week, and four months.

This paper introduces a novel approach to augmenting weak projection-based classifiers using a Neural Network within a stacking ensemble framework. The proposed method capitalizes on the diverse strengths of both linear and complex models, harnessing the interpretability of projection-based classifiers, while leveraging the pattern recognition capabilities of Neural Networks. We present a comprehensive algorithm involving dataset selection, preprocessing, base model training, meta-feature generation, and Neural Network architecture design and training. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency of our approach on a variety of high-dimensional biomedical datasets. Our results showcase significant accuracy improvements over standalone projection-based classifiers and conventional ensemble methods. We analyze the interpretability of the hybrid ensemble, shedding light on the insights drawn from its Neural Network component.

	of miRNA-gene interactions to date in a plethora of experimental settings, tissues and cell-types. It catalogues 6 million
	entries, comprising 2 million unique miRNA-gene pairs, supported by 37 experimental (high- and low-yield) protocols in 
	172 tissues and cell-types. Interactions are annotated with rich metadata including information on genes/transcripts, miRNAs, 
	samples, experimental contexts and publications, while millions of miRNA-binding locations are also provided at cell-type resolution. 
	A completely re-designed interface with state-of-the-art web technologies, incorporates more features, and allows flexible and ingenious 
	use. The new interface provides the capability to design sophisticated queries with numerous filtering criteria including cell lines, 
	experimental conditions, cell types, experimental methods, species and/or tissues of interest. Additionally, a plethora of fine-tuning
	capacities have been integrated to the platform, offering the refinement of the returned interactions based on miRNA confidence
	and expression levels, while boundless local retrieval of the offered interactions and metadata is enabled.}",

	abstract = {Computational Medicine encompasses the application of Statistical Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence methods on several traditional medical approaches, including biochemical testing which is extremely valuable both for early disease prognosis and long-term individual monitoring, as it can provide important information about a person's health status. However, using Statistical Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence algorithms to analyze biochemical test data from Electronic Health Records requires several preparatory steps, such as data manipulation and standardization. This study presents a novel approach for utilizing Electronic Health Records from large, real-world databases to develop predictive precision medicine models by exploiting Artificial Intelligence. Furthermore, to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, we compare the performance of various traditional Statistical Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms in predicting individuals' future biochemical test outcomes. Specifically, using data from a large real-world database, we exploit a longitudinal format of the data in order to predict the future values of 15 biochemical tests and identify individuals at high risk. The proposed approach and the extensive model comparison contribute to the personalized approach that modern medicine aims to achieve.},

	abstract="The emergence of novel data collection methods has led to the accumulation of vast amounts of unlabelled data. Discovering well separated groups of data samples through clustering is a critical but challenging task. In recent years various techniques to detect isolated and boundary points have been developed. In this work, we propose a clustering methodology that enables us to discover boundary data effectively, discriminating them from outliers. The proposed methodology utilizes a well established density based clustering method designed for high dimensional data, to develop a new ensemble scheme. The experimental results demonstrate very good performance, indicating that the approach has the potential to be used in diverse domains.",
